# Learning-React

Saving my experiments with react, while learning

Trying to understand how react works:

most of the steps came from here:

Notes:

Very important to understand that everything that you put on the app folder (in this case, is my shared folder) is meant for both ios and android, as a good practice you should name any specific component for ios or android with the subfix <name>.<ios|android>.js so things dont get mixed, that way, its easier to know what needs to be rewritten in order to make the app run in one or another OS.


Anything that works with Javascript Core, works with react. (V6 Javascript engine of chrome but for Ios)

npm install --save <package name>; works wonders and modifies package.json file like a boss


Extras:

Got Ngrok to publish my local ports:
